## About

ChatGPT-Jedi is an Emacs Lisp package that gives you Jedi powers. Yer a space wizard now, Harry.

(The name collision with the python Jedi package is coincidence.)

## Installation

ChatGPT-Jedi isn’t on melpa or elpa. You can use use-package to install from github:

```elisp
(use-package chatgpt-jedi
  :straight (:host github :repo "CarlQLange/ChatGPT-Jedi.el" :files ("*.el"))
  :init (setq chatgpt-jedi-api-key "your-api-key-here"))
```

## Usage

There are various interactive functions available, such as `chatgpt-jedi-replace-region`, `chatgpt-insert-at-point`, and more. Certain ones even have functionality.

## Requirements

You will need to have an API key from OpenAI’s GPT-3 language model to use this package, and set it as `chatgpt-jedi-api-key`. You can sign up for an API key on the OpenAI website. Depending on how much you use the package, the API cost may vary.

I strongly recommend setting a low usage limit on your account to stop runaway spending. The default model is quite cheap but it costs nothing to be prudent.

## Credits

This package was developed by Carl Lange with judicious help from ChatGPT.
